hi! i'm Com (she/her)<br>
i mainly code in JavaScript and C#, but you might find some other fun stuff around here.<br>
i play a lot of [hackmud](https://www.hackmud.com) and i'm working on an app.<br>
you can reach me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/com1killer) if you want to talk.<br>
on other socials you can find me as `com1killer` or occasionally as `com`.<br>
fun fact: i wrote this at 2AM after finding out about this feature, so this might not make sense
